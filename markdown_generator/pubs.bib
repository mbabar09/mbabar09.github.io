              Machine-learning potentials are accelerating the development of energy materials, especially in identifying phase diagrams and other thermodynamic properties. In this work, we present a neural network potential based on atom-centered symmetry function descriptors to model the energetics of lithium intercalation into graphite. The potential was trained on a dataset of over 9000 diverse lithium–graphite configurations that varied in applied stress and strain, lithium concentration, lithium–carbon and lithium–lithium bond distances, and stacking order to ensure wide sampling of the potential atomic configurations during intercalation. We calculated the energies of these structures using density functional theory (DFT) through the Bayesian error estimation functional with van der Waals correlation exchange-correlation functional, which can accurately describe the van der Waals interactions that are crucial to determining the thermodynamics of this phase space. Bayesian optimization, as implemented in
              Dragonfly
              , was used to select optimal set of symmetry function parameters, ultimately resulting in a potential with a prediction error of 8.24 meV atom
              −1
              on unseen test data. The potential can predict energies, structural properties, and elastic constants at an accuracy comparable to other DFT exchange-correlation functionals at a fraction of the computational cost. The accuracy of the potential is also comparable to similar machine-learned potentials describing other systems. We calculate the open circuit voltage with the calculator and find good agreement with experiment, especially in the regime

	abstract = {V2O5 in its ω phase (Li3V2O5) with excess lithium is a potential alternative to the graphite anode for lithium-ion batteries at low temperature and fast charging conditions owing to its safer voltage (0.6 V vs Li+/Li(s)) and high lithium transport rate. Inoperando cationic disorder, as observed in most ordered materials, can produce significant changes in charge compensation mechanisms, anionic activity, lithium diffusion, and operational voltages. In this work, we report the variation in structural distortion, electronic structure, and migration barrier accompanied by disorder using firstprinciples calculations. Owing to the segregation of lithium atoms in the disordered state, we observe greater distortion, emergence of metallic behavior, and potential anionic activity from nonbonding oxygen states near the Fermi level. Redox capacity can be tuned by doping with 3d metals, which can adjust the participating cationic states, and by fluorine substitution, which can stabilize or suppress anionic states. Moreover, the suppression of anionic activity is found to decrease structural distortion, which is crucial for mitigating voltage fade and hysteresis. Diffusion barrier calculations in the presence of disorder indicate the activation of the remaining 3D paths for lithium hopping which are unavailable in the ordered configuration, explaining its fast-charging ability observed in experiments.},
