I'm a PhD candidate in [Prof. Venkatasubramanian Viswanathan's group](https://www.cmu.edu/me/venkatgroup/) in the department of Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. My broad interests are in electrochemical kinetics, solid state physics, machine learning and density functional theory in energy materials.

# About this site
This website is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub Pages. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!
