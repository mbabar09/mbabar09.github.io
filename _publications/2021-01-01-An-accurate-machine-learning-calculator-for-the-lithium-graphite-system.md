We developed a DFT-based machine learning potential of the Lithium Graphite system using the Behlerâ€“Parrinello Neural Network and Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. The potential can accurately predict the stacking, lattice constants and open circuit voltage over the charge cycle \[[link](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7655/abc96f){:target="_blank"}\]
