Using tight binding density of states in twisted trilayer graphene, we found unconventional high electron transfer rates at incommensurate twist angles away from magic angles. This feature is accessible only in multilayer graphene, which retains high activity with wide range of redox couples. Temperature can switch activity between magic/incommensurate angles. \[[link](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jacs.4c03464){:target="_blank"}\]
