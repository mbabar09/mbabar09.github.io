We resolve spatial domains and flat band features on the twisted bilayer graphene surface by solving the steady state charge transport equation inside a 3D nanopipette volume. We find best resolution at magic angle twist, with 2-5nm nanopipette radii and -0.05 V applied voltage. We also report a 2D map of electrochemical current from scanning the nanopipette over the bilayer 2D surface. \[[link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00028){:target="_blank"}\]
