We use Machine learning-assisted Density Functional Theory calculations to analyze the magnetic moment evolution in two model Li-rich Ni-rich cathode materials during charge-discharge. We find cationic redox is characterized by a monotonic increase in total magnetic moment, with almost negligle oxygen contribution. However, the total magnetic moment undergoes a drop during anionic redox as oxygen electrons get paired with discharge. Magnetic moment hence forms a fast redox monitoring tool for Li-rich transition metal oxide cathodes.
