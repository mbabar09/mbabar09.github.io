We theoretically determined electron-transfer rates from novel flat bands in twisted trilayer graphene by incorporated tight-binding density of states in a modified Marcus Hush Chidsey rate model. Experimental collaborators at UC Berkeley validated results and reported unique dependence of rates on interlayer electron density.
